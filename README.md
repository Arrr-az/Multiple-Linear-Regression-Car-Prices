# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Car-Prices-
Predicting car prices using Multiple Linear Regression and sklearn LinearRegression model.

Challenges faced:
- Visualizing each individual feature's linear relation with "price" (target value);
- Normalizing data;
- Encoding categorical features using direct encoding and "one-hot encoding".

Notebook contains some personal conceptual insights I got while implementing and researching.
